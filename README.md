# Next.js 14 + Firebase Project with TailwindCSS Auto-Sorting
Made by Adrian Angelo Abelarde & Dzelle Faith Tan

This project demonstrates the integration of Next.js 14 Server Actions with Firebase for building scalable web applications, leveraging the utility-first CSS framework TailwindCSS with auto-sorting for a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Next.js 14 Server Actions**: Utilize the latest Next.js features for server-side logic directly within your pages or API routes.
- **Firebase Integration**: Seamlessly connect to Firebase for authentication, database, storage, and more.
- **TailwindCSS**: Implement responsive and stylish designs easily with TailwindCSS.
- **Auto-Sorting**: Automatically sort TailwindCSS classes and import statements for readability and consistency.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (14.x or later)
- npm or Yarn
- Git (for version control)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drianlarde/nextjs14-server-actions-firebase-boilerplate.git
cd your-project-directory
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure Firebase**:

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add your Firebase configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=""
```

For auto-sorting TailwindCSS classes, install the necessary plugins or configure your code formatter accordingly.

4. **Run the development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your project.
